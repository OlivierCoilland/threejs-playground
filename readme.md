# threejs-playground

My playground with [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/).

## Usage ##

Clone the repository then:

```
npm install
```

And open any html file in a browser supporting WebGL (Firefox does).

- earth.html: our beloved planet. Note how huge the Pacific Ocean is!
- solar.html: all the planets side by side.
